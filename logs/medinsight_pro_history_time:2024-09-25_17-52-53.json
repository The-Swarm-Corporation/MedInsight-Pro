This virus primarily attacks respiratory system, but numerous individuals complain persistent skeletal muscle pain or worsening pre-existing muscle pain post COVID-19, which severely affects the quality of life and recovery. Currently, there is limited research on the skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. In this brief review, we review potential pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID, and summarize the various auxiliary examinations and treatments for skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. We consider abnormal activation of inflammatory response, myopathy, and neurological damages as pivotal pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. A comprehensive examination is significantly important in order to work out effective treatment plans and relieve skeletal muscle pain. So far, rehabilitation interventions for myalgia in long COVID contain but are not limited to drug, nutraceutical therapy, gut microbiome-targeted therapy, interventional therapy and strength training. Our study provides a potential mechanism reference for clinical researches, highlighting the importance of comprehensive approach and management of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. The relief of skeletal muscle pain will accelerate rehabilitation process, improve activities of daily living and enhance the quality of life, promoting individuals return to society with profound significance.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Title\": \"A multidisciplinary approach to assessment and management of long COVID cognitive concerns.\",\n                    \"PMID\": \"39299386\",\n                    \"Authors\": [\n                        \"Schultz KR\",\n                        \"McGrath S\",\n                        \"Keary TA\",\n                        \"Meng CK\",\n                        \"Batchos E\",\n                        \"Evans L\",\n                        \"Fields D\",\n                        \"Cummings A\",\n                        \"Fornalski N\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Source\": \"Life sciences\",\n                    \"PublicationDate\": {\n                        \"Year\": \"2024\",\n                        \"Month\": \"Sep\",\n                        \"Day\": \"18\"\n                    },\n                    \"Abstract\": \"Cognitive dysfunction is a commonly reported feature of Long COVID (LC).

Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10-20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath. However, more than 200 symptoms have been reported. No phenotypic or diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for developing long COVID/PASC, which is a multisystem disorder that can present with isolated or combined respiratory, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no cure. Therefore, individualized patient management requires a multidisciplinary clinical approach.

To date, there are no causal treatments available for PASC. While initial studies show that psychotherapy improves psychological symptoms, PASC-related fatigue, and psychosocial functioning, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment for PASC. This study presents a non-randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a five-week multimodal inpatient psychosomatic treatment program for individuals experiencing PASC symptoms and comorbid mental illness. A total of 118 patients presented at the Post-COVID Center at the Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen will be assigned to the intervention group receiving inpatient psychosomatic treatment or the control group receiving treatment as usual. The inclusion criteria for the intervention group are a diagnosis of PASC and at least one condition of mental distress and problems with coping with illness. The primary objective of the intervention is to reduce mental ailments, including depression and anxiety, as well as neurocognitive deficits, and to address PASC symptoms such as fatigue and pain. The core elements of the treatment are psychotherapy in individual and group settings, medical treatment, neurocognitive training, and physical therapy, adapted to the individual's capacity and oriented towards the concept of pacing. After enrollment, participants will undergo a 6-month follow-up to assess long-term results and the sustainability of the intervention effects. This study examines the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment in PASC patients with comorbid mental illness in comparison with a control group based on treatment as usual.

We searched Medline, Web of Science (Core Collection), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), without language restrictions, for articles published from December 1, 2019 through October 10, 2023, to ensure all relevant studies were captured. We included studies that enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years) diagnosed with CVD prior to COVID-19 infection whose infection was subsequently determined to be LC per the World Health Organization definition. We excluded studies with adults diagnosed with CVD concurrent with or subsequent to COVID-19 or with those who solely self-reported LC. We used a custom-built data extraction form to collect a range of study characteristics. Study quality was assessed using modified versions of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality-assessment tools. A total of 13,779 studies were identified; 53 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 27 were of good quality and 26 were of fair quality. Health outcomes consisted of the presence of prolonged symptoms of LC (n\u00a0= 29), physiological health outcomes (n\u00a0= 20), lifestyle behaviours (n\u00a0= 19), psycho-social outcomes (n\u00a0= 13), CVD complications (n\u00a0= 5), and death and hospital readmission (n\u00a0= 5). Thirty-four studies incorporated 2 or more outcomes, and 19 integrated only\u00a01. Given the significant impact of LC among individuals with preexisting CVD, specially tailored clinical management is needed for members of this population. Additional studies on the impact of LC among those with CVD and other underlying conditions also would be beneficial.\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"semantic_scholar_results\": null,\n            \"combined_summary\": \"### Summary of Recent Research on Long COVID\\n\\n1. **Myalgia in Long COVID**  \\n   - **Study**: Zhai et al.

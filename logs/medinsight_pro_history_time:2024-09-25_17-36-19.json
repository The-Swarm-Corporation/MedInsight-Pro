Therfore, It makes sense to test the clinical effect of AD against COVID-19 and Long COVID. On May 20, 2024, this systematic scoping review in PUBMED identified 1016 articles related to AD and COVID-19, Long COVID and SARS-COV-2. These included 10 retrospective \"large scale\" studies (> 20000 chart reviews), 8 prospective clinical trials (plus 4 regarding Long COVID), 11 placebo-controlled randomized (RCT) (plus 2 regarding Long COVID) and 15 meta-analyses. COVID-19: Retrospective studies with cohorts taking AD primarily for psychiatric comorbidities or chronic pain conditions directly prior to SARS-COV-2 infection described that this substance class (most studied: Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors (SSRI) and Selective Serotonin Noradrenaline Re-Uptake Inhibitors (SSNRI)) were associated with (i) significantly fewer SARS-COV-2 infections and (ii) a milder course of COVID-19 (\"COVID-19 protection\"). Ten of the 11 RCTs found regarding COVID-19 tested fluvoxamine, as this old AD appeared suitable as a prophylactic agent against severe COVID-19, taking into account its in vitro potency against the progression of intracellular sepsis cascades. Therefore, most (12 out of 15) meta-analyses also referred to fluvoxamine. They found (iii) a significant (40-70% reduction) in mortality, intubation and hospitalization rates when fluvoxamine was used as an add-on to standard therapy for mild to moderate COVID-19. When this AD was used in the early stages of the disease, it was more successful than when it was given later in advanced, severe COVID-19 (e.g. severe pneumonia, final sepsis stages). A dose dependency was observed: 2x50 mg fluvoxamine over 15 days was less effective than 2x100 or even 3x100 mg with an adverse event profile still at the placebo level. Direct comparisons with drugs approved for COVID-19 do not yet exist. A first indirect meta-analytical comparison showed an advantage of paxlovid or molnupiravir versus fluvoxamine against the development of severe COVID-19: risk reduction of 95% (I2 = N/A, but only one study) or 78% (I2=0) versus 5+-5% (I2=48). However, an add-on of fluvoxamine was still significantly more efficacious than symptom-oriented standard therapy alone. Long COVID: A common Long COVID phenotype with dominant anxiety and depression symptoms, which responds to AD, relaxation therapy and/or psychotherapy, has now been identified. Casuistics report positive effects of AD on fatigue, cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions. A first large prospective open-label RCT has just shown significantly more favourable courses, less viral load and less pro-inflammatory cytokines in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 with fluvoxamine versus standard treatment, also with regard to the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric and pulmonary Long COVID or fatigue. Overall, there is promising evidence of a preventive effect of AD (especially fluvoxamine) against progression to severe COVID-19 and against the development of Long COVID. It is likely, that the entire AD substance class could be effective here. This assumption is based on the results of retrospective large scale studies, but awaits verification by better controlled studies. The potential effectiveness/efficacy (currently low and moderate confidence of the evidence for the entire substance class and specifically fluvoxamine, respectively) of fluvoxamine as an add-on against COVID-19 and possibly also directly against Long COVID could stimulate similar projects in other infectious diseases that also have the potential to pose a lasting threat to the health of those affected. We consider the evidence to date to be sufficient to be able to emphasize a possible positive effect of these substances in the psychoeducation of patients with COVID-19 or Long COVID who are already receiving AD for other conditions - especially also against the symptoms associated with the viral disease or its consequences. In regions where neither vaccines nor antiviral agents currently approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 are available, AD and in particular fluvoxamine would be a cost-effective alternative to protect against a severe course, even if this AD appears to have a smaller effect against COVID-19 than the currently approved antiviral agents, but with presumably better tolerability. A direct comparative clinical trial with approved antiviral agents is still pending and should be positive to further open the door for a guideline-based recommendation of fluvoxamine (or perhaps even AD) for COVID-19 or its aftermath."}, {"Title": "Advance in the mechanism and clinical research of myalgia in long COVID.", "PMID": "39310121", "Authors": ["Zhai X", "Wu W", "Zeng S", "Miao Y"], "Source": "American journal of clinical and experimental immunology", "PublicationDate": {"Year": "2024"}, "Abstract": "As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve, mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have significantly decreased.

This virus primarily attacks respiratory system, but numerous individuals complain persistent skeletal muscle pain or worsening pre-existing muscle pain post COVID-19, which severely affects the quality of life and recovery. Currently, there is limited research on the skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. In this brief review, we review potential pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID, and summarize the various auxiliary examinations and treatments for skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. We consider abnormal activation of inflammatory response, myopathy, and neurological damages as pivotal pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. A comprehensive examination is significantly important in order to work out effective treatment plans and relieve skeletal muscle pain. So far, rehabilitation interventions for myalgia in long COVID contain but are not limited to drug, nutraceutical therapy, gut microbiome-targeted therapy, interventional therapy and strength training. Our study provides a potential mechanism reference for clinical researches, highlighting the importance of comprehensive approach and management of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID.

Accurate measurement of symptom burden and its consequences is needed to manage conditions such as long COVID, and several tools have been developed to do so. However, no patient-reported instrument existed in the German language at the time of writing. This study, therefore, aimed to develop a German version of the COVID-19 Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale (C19-YRS). We conducted a translation and qualitative evaluation, including cultural adaptation, of the C19-YRS and assessed its face validity. After creating a preliminary version, 26 individuals (14 women [53%]) participated in cognitive interviews (January 2022 to March 2022). Using cognitive debriefing interviews, we ensured the content's comprehensibility. The matrix-framework method guided the qualitative data analysis.

Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10-20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath.

This review seeks to encompass an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19, including its transmission, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation related to various systems within the human body. COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness that has rapidly spread worldwide. As of August 4, 2023, the WHO reported over 570 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 6.3 million deaths. Although the virus is most common in adults, children can also be infected. Respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are the primary transmission mode for COVID-19. Additionally, the virus can be disseminated via contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, as it can remain viable for several hours or days. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that enters cells by bonding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Once inside the cell, the virus replicates and produces new particles that can infect other cells. Interestingly, the effects of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) encompass more than just respiratory system. The findings presented in the data suggest that PASC significantly impacts multiple organs and their respective physiological processes. In light of these observations, we aim to provide a detailed discussion of the relevant findings in this paper. Through our review, we hope to provide healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the effects of PASC on the human body, which could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes and treatment strategies."}, {"Title": "Effects of yoga compared with health promotion on health-related quality of life in adults with post-COVID-19 condition: protocol for a randomised controlled trial.", "PMID": "39266315", "Authors": ["Brod\u00e9n M", "Welfordsson P", "Niemi M", "Diwan V", "Shah K", "Pattanadara V", "Hallgren M"], "Source": "BMJ open", "PublicationDate": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "Sep", "Day": "12"}, "Abstract": "Post-COVID-19 condition (post COVID, also known as long COVID) is a global public health issue estimated to affect over 100\u2009million people.

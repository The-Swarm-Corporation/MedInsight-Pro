                "Abstract": "Third space endoscopy (TSE) or sub-mucosal endoscopy using a mucosal flap valve (SEMF) enables the endoscopist to operate in the deeper layers of the gastrointestinal tract or gain access to the mediastinal/peritoneal cavity for natural orifice transoral endoscopic surgery (NOTES). TSE procedures are essentially endoscopic surgical procedures with a variable learning curve. Adverse events (AEs) during TSE are specific and follow a certain pattern across the spectrum of TSE procedures. These can be broadly categorized according to either type of AE, time of presentation relative to the procedure or according to degree of severity. Three major categories of AEs encountered during TSE include insufflation related AEs, mucosal injuries (MIs) and bleeding. Other relevant AEs include infectious complications, aspiration pneumonia, post-procedural chest/abdominal pain, atelectasis, cardiac arrhythmias, pleural effusion and pulmonary embolism. Reported incidence of AEs during TSE procedures varies according to the type and complexity of procedure. Acquaintance regarding potential risk factors, technical tips and precautions, alarm signs for early recognition, assessment of degree of severity, morphological characterization of AEs and finally, expeditious selection of appropriate management strategy are crucial and imperative for successful clinical outcomes. The current review discusses the current evidence and practical guidelines for prevention, early detection and management of TSE-related AEs."

                "Abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurring in patients with hematological malignancies (HM) is a life-threatening condition with specific features. Mortality rate remains high but improvement has been described over the past several years. We aimed to describe characteristics and outcomes of ARDS in HM patients admitted in French ICUs (Intensive Care Units) during a one year-period. Data for this nationwide cohort study were collected from the French national hospital database (Programme de M\u00e9dicalisation des Syst\u00e8mes d'Information (PMSI)). All patients (18 years or older) admitted to French ICUs in 2017 and with a diagnosis of ARDS were included. Three groups were compared according to the presence of an HM, a solid cancer or no cancer. The primary endpoint was 90-day mortality. Secondary endpoints were the description of ICU management, etiologies of ARDS and mortality risk factors. A total of 12 846 patients with ARDS were included. Among them, 990 had HM and 2744 had a solid cancer. The main malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (28.5%), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (20.4%) and multiple myeloma (19.7%). Day-90 mortality in patients with HM was higher than in patients with no cancer (64.4% vs. 46.6% p\u2009=\u20090.01) but was not different from that of patients with solid cancer (64.4% vs. 61.4%,p\u2009=\u20090.09). Intubation rate was lower in patients with HM in comparison with both groups (87.7% vs. 90.4% p\u2009=\u20090.02 for patients with solid cancer and 87.7% vs. 91.3%; p\u2009<\u20090.01 with no cancer). Independent predictors of mortality for patients with HM were a diagnosis of lymphoma or acute leukemia, age, a high modified SAPS II score, a renal replacement therapy, invasive fungal infection, and a septic shock. Bacterial pneumonia, extrapulmonary infections and non-invasive ventilation were protective. Mortality remains high in patients with HM admitted in ICU with ARDS in comparison with patients without cancer. Mortality predictors for this population were a diagnosis of lymphoma or acute leukemia, age, a high modified SAPS II score, a renal replacement therapy, invasive fungal infection and a septic shock."

                "Abstract": "The knee joint remains the most affected joint in extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD). Given the increasing prevalence of CD and overall demand for total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is likely that an increasing number of patients with CD will require TKA. The purpose of this study was to assess the inpatient postoperative complication in patients with CD undergoing TKA. We queried the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between the years of 2016 to 2019, including a total of 558,371 patients who underwent primary TKA. Among these, 1461 were in the CD group and 556,910 were in the non-CD group (controls). Data pertaining to demographics, length of stay (LOS), total healthcare cost, mortality, and in-hospital complications (blood loss anemia, blood transfusion, periprosthetic infection, periprosthetic dislocation, periprosthetic mechanical complication, acute renal failure, myocardial infarction, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, superficial/deep surgical site infection, and wound dehiscence) were compared between the two groups. Patients diagnosed with CD had higher postoperative complications such as blood loss anemia (OR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.07-1.39, p\u2009=\u20090.004), periprosthetic infection (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.23-2.63, p\u2009=\u20090.006), and the need for blood transfusion (OR: 1.447, 95% CI: 1.01-2.06, p\u2009=\u20090.044) in comparison to the control group. In-hospital mortality and acute renal failure were similar in both groups. The CD group had a significantly prolonged LOS (2.54 vs. 2.35 days, p\u2009<\u20090.001). No statistically significant difference was noted concerning in-hospital charges between the two groups. CD patients undergoing TKA experienced increased LOS and postoperative complications. However, these complications were minor and did not affect total hospital cost. Further prospective cohort studies could build upon the findings described to continue to maximize outcomes in CD patients undergoing TKA, which might extend to other cohorts."

                "Abstract": "Owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many developmental-behavioral pediatric (DBP) practices adopted telehealth for care delivery. However, telehealth access and use for families with a preferred language other than English (PLOE) is an equity concern. Therefore, our study objective is to compare rates of telehealth utilization and visit completion by preferred family language among patients seen for DBP assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We completed a descriptive chart review using electronic health record data at 4 academic DBP practices to examine visits for patients up to 5 years seen for new-patient appointments between April 2020 and April 2021. We compared rates of in-person and telehealth visits by preferred family language and visit outcome (completed or missed). A total of 3241 visits were scheduled between April 2020 and April 2021; 48.2% were for in-person and 51.8% for telehealth. Families reported the following languages: 90.5% English, 6.2% Spanish, and 3.3% other language. Missed visits accounted for 7.6% of scheduled visits. The relative percentage of in-person versus telehealth visits varied significantly by site (p < 0.001) and preferred family language (p < 0.001). English-speaking patients had 2.10 times the odds of being scheduled for telehealth compared with patients with PLOE, adjusting for site. Statistically significant differences were not found for visit outcome (completed or missed) by visit type (in-person or telehealth) (p = 0.79), including after accounting for PLOE status (p = 0.83). At the height of the pandemic, most English-speaking families were scheduled for new DBP evaluations by telehealth, but fewer families with PLOE were. Attention to language to ensure telehealth access equity is critical."

                "Abstract": "Several infectious pulmonary diseases affect the eye. An understanding of the association between infectious pulmonary and ocular diseases is pivotal to their successful management. We aimed to review the infections affecting both the lungs and the eye. The electronic database PubMed and the search engine Google Scholar were searched for relevant articles. Ocular tuberculosis (TB), usually not associated with clinical evidence of pulmonary TB, can affect almost all the ocular structures. Confirmation of the diagnosis of ocular TB requires demonstration of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in ocular fluids/tissues. Among the drugs used to treat TB, ethambutol, isoniazid, and linezolid may cause toxic optic neuropathy. Elderly, those with renal disease, diabetes mellitus, malnourished, alcoholics, and those who will receive ethambutol at doses greater than 15 mg/kg/day and for prolonged periods are at high risk of developing toxic optic neuropathy. These individuals should be referred to an ophthalmologist before initiating ATT for a baseline ophthalmic evaluation. Linezolid may also cause toxic retinal neuropathy. Rifampicin may cause yellowish-orange discoloration of tears and contact lenses. Adenovirus, coronavirus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus exhibit both pulmonary and ocular tropism. Pneumocystis jirovecii choroiditis is rare and mainly seen when aerosolized pentamidine is used for pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis. Further research is needed to develop non-interventional strategies to diagnose ocular TB. Biomarkers for early detection of toxic optic neuropathy are a need of the hour. Genetic factors and mechanisms behind the development of ethambutol, isoniazid, and linezolid-induced toxic optic neuropathy need further study."

                "Abstract": "Sarcopenia is a contributing factor in the development of long-COVID syndrome. We aimed to investigate how intercostal muscle mass changes over 3 months compared to other chest wall muscles following COVID-19 infection, along with identifying factors contributing to intercostal muscle loss during follow-up. We retrospectively studied 110 COVID-19 patients, analyzing muscle masses in the intercostal, pectoralis, and thoracic 12th vertebra level (T12) on initial and follow-up CT scans. Muscle mass was quantitatively assessed using density histogram analysis. We calculated the muscle difference ratio (MDR) as the following formula: (initial muscle mass - follow-up muscle mass)/initial muscle mass. Patients were categorized into 2 groups: <3 months follow-up (n\u2005=\u200553) and\u2005\u2265\u20053 months follow-up (n\u2005=\u200557). We employed stepwise logistic regression, using intercostal MDR\u2005\u2265\u200525% in follow-up as an independent variable and age\u2005<\u200565 years, ventilator use, steroid use, follow-up\u2005>\u20053 months, hospital stay\u2005>\u200513 days, body mass index\u2005<\u200518.5\u2009kg/m\u00b2, and female gender as dependent variables. The loss of intercostal muscle was the most severe among the 3 chest wall muscles in the CT follow-up. Intercostal MDR was significantly higher in the\u2005\u2265\u20053 months follow-up group compared to the\u2005<\u20053 months group (32.5\u2005\u00b1\u200523.6% vs 19.0\u2005\u00b1\u200521.1%, P\u2005=\u2005.002). There were no significant differences in pectoralis MDR or T12 MDR between the 2 groups. Stepwise logistic regression identified steroid use (3.494 (1.419-8.604), P\u2005=\u2005.007) and a follow-up period\u2005>\u20053 months [3.006 (1.339-6.748), P\u2005=\u2005.008] as predictors of intercostal MDR\u2005\u2265\u200525%. The intercostal muscle wasting was profound compared to that in the pectoralis and T12 skeletal muscles in a follow-up CT scan, and the intercostal muscle wasting was further aggravated after 3 months of COVID-19 infection. The use of steroids and a follow-up period exceeding 3 months were significant predictors for\u2005\u2265\u200525% of intercostal muscle wasting in follow-up."

We used bioinformatics methods to identify the common hub genes in these 2 diseases. Two RNA-seq datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus were used to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in COVID-19 and sepsis. These common genes were used for analysis of functional enrichment; pathway analysis; identification of associated transcription factors, metabolites, and miRNAs; and mapping of protein-protein interaction networks. The major hub genes of COVID-19 and sepsis were identified, and validation datasets were used to assess the value of these hub genes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Analysis of the 800 common DEGs for COVID-19 and sepsis, as well as common transcription factors, miRNAs, and metabolites, demonstrated that the immune response had a key role in both diseases. DLGAP5, BUB1, CDK1, CCNB1, and BUB1B were the most important common hub genes. Analysis of a validation cohort indicated these 5 genes had significantly higher expression in COVID-19 patients and sepsis patients than in corresponding controls, and the area under the ROC curves ranged from 0.832 to 0.981 for COVID-19 and 0.840 to 0.930 for sepsis. We used bioinformatics tools to identify common DEGs, miRNAs, and transcription factors for COVID-19 and sepsis. The 5 identified hub genes had higher expression in validation cohorts of COVID-19 and sepsis. These genes had good or excellent diagnostic performance based on ROC analysis, and therefore have potential use as novel markers or therapeutic targets."

We conducted this study to estimate the Re(t) of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 Omicron in Shenyang, China. Data on the daily incidence of this Corona Virus Disease 2019 outbreak between March 5, 2022, and April 25, 2022, in Shenyang, China, were downloaded from the Nationwide Notifiable Infectious Diseases Reporting Information System. Infector-infectee pairs were identified through epidemiological investigation. Re(t) was estimated by R-studio Package \"EpiEstim\" based on Bayesian framework through parameter and nonparametric method, respectively. About 1134 infections were found in this outbreak, with 20 confirmed cases and 1124 asymptomatic infections. Fifty-four infector-infectee pairs were identified and formed a serial interval list, and 15 infector-infectee pairs were included in the generation time table. Re(t) calculated by parameter and nonparametric method all peaked on March 17, 2022, with a value of 2.58 and 2.54 and decreased to <1 after March 28, 2022. There was no statistical difference in the Re(t) distribution calculated using the 2 methods (t\u2005=\u20050.001, P\u2005>\u2005.05). The present study indicated that the decisive response of Shenyang, China, played a significant role in preventing the spread of the epidemic, and the retrospective analysis provided novel insights into the outbreak response to future public health emergencies."

Psychosomatic changes such as stress levels, violence experience, depression, suicidal ideation, suicidal plans, and suicide attempts were significantly lower in COVID-19 pandemic compared to COVID-19 prepandemic (P\u2005<\u2005.001). After adjusting for multiple confounding variables, less alcohol consumption (odds ratio [OR] = 0.98; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.88-0.93), less exercise (OR = 0.92; 95% CI = 0.89-0.94), less sexual experience (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.77-0.86), less violence experience (OR = 0.61; 95% CI = 0.55-0.67), less stress (OR = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.84-0.88), less depression (OR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.83-0.88), less suicidal ideation (OR = 0.93; 95% CI = 0.89-0.97), plans (OR = 0.82; 95% CI = 0.76-0.88), attempts (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.71-0.85) were significantly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic compared to COVID-19 prepandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with changes in health risk behaviors among Korean adolescents, resulting in alcohol drinking, sexual experience, drug use, violence experience, and suicidal behaviors (idea, plan, and attempts) being decreased during the lockdown period."

                "Abstract": "In this study, we analyzed the efficacy of animated educational videos and group nursing in the treatment of severe pneumonia in children. A total of 140 patients with severe pneumonia in our hospital from October 2022 to October 2023 were selected as the research subjects, and they were divided into a control group and an observation group. The control group received routine care, while the observation group received animated educational videos and cluster nursing interventions. The treatment effects of the 2 groups of patients were compared. Clinical indicators such as body temperature recovery time, blood oxygen saturation recovery time, heart rate recovery time, consciousness recovery time, and respiratory rate recovery time were compared between the 2 groups of patients. The results showed that the temperature recovery time, oxygen saturation recovery time, heart rate recovery time and respiratory rate recovery time in observation group were significantly different from those in control group (P\u2005<\u2005.05). Univariate analysis showed that families with or without anxiety disorder had statistically significant differences in economic conditions, extrapulmonary complications, nursing methods and other aspects. Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that nursing methods, extrapulmonary complications, and poor economic conditions (income\u2005<\u20055000) were risk factors for anxiety among family members of severe pneumonia patients, while good economic conditions (income\u2005>\u20055000) were protective factors. So, animated educational videos and bundled care can effectively improve the nursing effectiveness of children with severe pneumonia and promote their recovery."

The aim of this single-center cohort study was to evaluate the frequency and severity of VAEs and associated complications in patients undergoing neurosurgery in the lounging position. From 2010 to 2020, 1000 patients, including 172 patients with a patent foramen ovale, underwent surgery in the lounging position for different neurosurgical pathologies. All patients were monitored intraoperatively using continuous transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). The anesthesia team documented any observed incidences of VAEs and scored their severity according to the Tuebingen classification system (TCS) for VAE (TCS-VAE). The patients' clinical condition, radiological findings, and hospital course were subsequently analyzed to assess complications in a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data. In the cohort of 1000 patients, 5 underwent cervical spine surgery and 995 underwent suboccipital craniotomy. VAE was detected by TEE in 51.4% (95% CI 48.4%-54.5%) of patients, with synchronous changes in end-tidal CO2 (grade 2-5 TCS-VAE) noted in 10.2% (95% CI 8.3%-12.3%). None of the patients presented with hemodynamic instability (grade 5 TCS-VAE). Patients with high-grade VAEs were significantly older (p = 0.02) and had lower BMIs (p = 0.001) than the respective mean value of the cohort. VAE grade was not associated with any of the outcome measures such as Karnofsky Performance Scale score, duration of ventilation, length of intensive care unit stay, and length of hospital stay. Postoperative acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed in 0.3% (95% CI 0.0%-0.7%, n = 3) of all cases, and ARDS was associated with perioperative VAE grade (p = 0.001). No patient suffered a new permanent neurological deficit due to a paradoxical VAE. In this large cohort, the risk of an intraoperative VAE during neurosurgery in the lounging position was assessed, and contrary to the general perception in the field, no permanent sequelae or fatal adverse events attributable to VAEs were observed. Furthermore, the overall incidence of ARDS was very low. This study clearly establishes that experienced interdisciplinary teams can safely use the lounging position for neurosurgical procedures."}, {"Title": "Optimal treatment strategy for low-grade spinal cord astrocytoma: a retrospective, multicenter analysis by the Neurospinal Society of Japan.", "PMID": "39303310", "Authors": ["Shigekawa S", "Inoue A", "Endo T", "Muto J", "Inoue T", "Kanematsu R", "Mitsuhara T", "Umebayashi D", "Mizuno M", "Hida K", "Kunieda T", "Unknown Author"], "Source": "Journal of neurosurgery.

The optimal treatment strategy thus remains unclear. The authors conducted a multicenter study led by the Neurospinal Society of Japan (NSJ) to analyze treatment policies and outcomes. The aim was to present optimal treatment methods for spinal cord astrocytoma and to identify predictors of better outcomes. Among 1033 consecutive cases of spinal cord intramedullary tumors treated surgically at 58 centers affiliated with the NSJ, 57 patients were diagnosed with diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II) and were enrolled in the present study. Among these 57 patients, treatment methods, outcomes, and tumor proliferation rate as evaluated by the MIB-1 staining index (SI) were analyzed, and the optimal treatment method for spinal cord astrocytomas (grade II) was determined. In addition, the authors searched for factors predicting better treatment outcomes. Treatment for spinal cord astrocytoma comprised three methods: surgery alone in 30 patients, adjuvant radiation therapy in 13 patients, and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy in 13 patients. One patient who did not undergo surgery was excluded from survival analysis. Treatment with surgery alone or surgery with radiotherapy was associated with significantly longer overall and progression-free survivals than that with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Patients treated with radiation therapy had a higher MIB-1 SI than those treated with surgery alone. The extent of tumor resection tended to correlate with longer survival. In contrast, postoperative neurological worsening showed the inverse order. Adjuvant chemoradiotherapy was associated with the shortest survival in both total cases and recurrent cases. The optimal cutoff value of MIB-1 SI for predicting longer survival by surgery alone was less than 4.0%. The optimal treatment for spinal cord astrocytoma is maximal tumor resection without neurological impairment. When some tumor remains in patients with an MIB-1 SI less than 4.0%, a wait-and-see approach is optimal. If the MIB-1 SI is higher than 4.0%, local radiation therapy is recommended. Adjuvant chemotherapy is not recommended for the treatment of grade II spinal cord astrocytoma."}, {"Title": "External lumbar drainage for the management of refractory intracranial hypertension in pediatric severe traumatic brain injury: a retrospective single-center case series.", "PMID": "39303308", "Authors": ["Guida L", "Visentin A", "Benichi S", "James S", "Paternoster G", "Bourgeois M", "Sauv\u00e9-Martin H", "Meyer P", "Montmayeur J", "Vergnaud E", "Dangouloff-Ros V", "Beccaria K", "Orliaguet G", "Blauwblomme T"], "Source": "Journal of neurosurgery.

However, ventriculostomy in children can sometimes be challenging because of the small size of the lateral ventricles. External lumbar drainage (ELD) may be a useful alternative; therefore, the authors analyzed the outcome of a cohort of pediatric patients who underwent ELD to manage intracranial hypertension (ICH). This study retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients with ICH following severe TBI who underwent ELD. Radiological and clinical severity scores (Marshall classification, Rotterdam score, Injury Severity Score, and Pediatric Trauma Score) were noted. ICP and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) curves were analyzed 12 hours before and after the procedure. Any change in medical therapy was recorded, as well as the total volume and duration of drainage. Cerebellar tonsillar position according to the McRae line was noted before and after ELD. Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended score at follow-up was also noted. Thirty patients were included, with a mean age of 8 \u00b1 4.4 years, and a median admission Glasgow Coma Scale score of 7 \u00b1 4 (range 3-13). ELD was performed after a median delay of 1 day (range 0-7 days), mean drainage volume/day was 296 \u00b1 129 ml, and median duration of drainage was 7 \u00b1 5 (range 2-12) days. Forty-three percent of the patients underwent ELD as a part of the first-tier therapy. ICP decreased after ELD (mean difference 13.4 \u00b1 6.2 mm Hg, p < 0.001), whereas CPP increased (mean difference 10.6 \u00b1 6.4 mm Hg, p < 0.001). Fifty-three percent of the cohort did not need any further second-tier therapy after ELD. The study found 1 case of drain revision and 3 cases of cerebellar tonsil herniation. These preliminary data suggest ELD is a valuable option to treat ICH in severely head-injured children, limiting the use of second-tier treatments. This pilot study should lay the foundation for a multicenter prospective trial."}, {"Title": "Clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes after endoscopic endonasal surgery for craniopharyngioma in the elderly.", "PMID": "39303301", "Authors": ["Bao YY", "Pan LS", "Cao Y", "Wu J", "Xie SH", "Ouyang F", "Tan J", "Wang QF", "Zhou DW", "Tang B", "Hong T"], "Source": "Journal of neurosurgery", "PublicationDate": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "Sep", "Day": "20"}, "Abstract": "Craniopharyngiomas (CPs) in adults are rare benign epithelial tumors, and few contemporary studies have explored outcomes after surgical treatment in elderly patients, especially with regard to endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES). A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients aged \u2265 18 years with CP who were treated with EES from 2013 to 2022. The cohort was divided into nonelderly (18-64 years) and elderly (\u2265 65 years) groups based on age. Various parameters, including patient and tumor characteristics, surgical outcomes, complications, and follow-up, were compared between the two age groups. A total of 193 patients met the inclusion criteria, with 161 (83.4%) patients in the nonelderly group and 32 (16.6%) patients in the elderly group. Preoperatively, older patients were more likely to have memory impairment (4.3% vs 18.8%, p = 0.010), fatigue or decreased energy (9.3% vs 34.4%, p = 0.001), hypopituitarism (68.7% vs 90.6%, p = 0.012), or hydrocephalus (18% vs 40.6%, p = 0.005), and they were more likely asymptomatic (1.2% vs 9.4%, p = 0.033) and less likely to experience headache (57.8% vs 31.3%, p = 0.006). Patients in the elderly group had a longer symptom duration (median [IQR] 5 [10] months vs 9.5 [13] months, p = 0.001) and higher comorbidity scores (p < 0.001). Postoperatively, gross-total resection was achieved in 145 (90.1%) and 28 (87.5%) patients in the nonelderly and elderly groups, respectively. Older patients were more likely to develop pneumonia (5% vs 21.9%, p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in the extent of resection (p = 0.541), pathological subtypes (88.2% vs 75.0% adamantinomatous, p = 0.089), operation time (mean \u00b1 SD 307.8 \u00b1 68.3 minutes vs 323.5 \u00b1 86.0 minutes, p = 0.257), estimated blood loss (median [IQR] 300 [200] ml vs 300 [238] ml, p = 0.594), length of stay (median [IQR] 15 [8] days vs 15 [22] days, p = 0.964), perioperative mortality (2.5% vs 3.1%, p > 0.99), or postoperative severe hypothalamic dysfunction (37.9% vs 50.0%, p = 0.237) between the groups. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated that tumor calcification (HR 3.406, 95% CI 1.859-27.233, p = 0.038) and preoperative hydrocephalus (HR 3.688, 95% CI 1.310-10.386, p = 0.013) were independently associated with decreased survival. The median follow-up period in the elderly group was shorter (71 months vs 44 months, p = 0.001), and no recurrence was observed (7.1% vs 0%, p = 0.132). This study demonstrates that EES is a viable treatment option for older CP patients. With appropriate perioperative management, EES does not significantly increase mortality and, in selected populations, is well tolerated by patients."}, {"Title": "Complications of intrathecal baclofen therapy in children and young adults.", "PMID": "39303297", "Authors": ["Ryan MV", "Freeman LM", "Blasco S", "Sawyer K", "Graber S", "Tong S", "Oleszek J", "Wilkinson C"], "Source": "Journal of neurosurgery.

The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all patients who had baclofen pumps implanted at a tertiary children's hospital from 2006 through June 2019. The study employed appropriate descriptive statistics and statistical models to analyze patient demographics, improvements in tone, and clinical complications. The authors evaluated the associations of complications as well as changes in modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) scores with various preexisting conditions (e.g., presence of gastrostomy tubes [G-tubes] and ventriculoperitoneal [VP] shunts) and surgical variations (e.g., use of newer [Ascenda] catheters and subfascial versus subcutaneous catheter tunneling). One hundred forty-two pumps were implanted. Complications occurred in 111 patients (78.2%). The most frequent complications were catheter complications and pseudomeningoceles, each of which occurred in 63 (44%) patients. On multivariable analysis, pseudomeningoceles and percutaneous CSF leaks were significantly less likely when intrathecal catheters were placed via laminotomy versus spinal needle (OR 4.6, p = 0.044), and when catheters were passed from the posterior incision to the abdominal pump pocket deep to the thoracolumbar fascia rather than superficial to it (OR 2.7, p = 0.008). Preexisting G-tubes and VP shunts at the time of pump implantation were not associated with a significantly increased likelihood of pump malfunction or infection. Ascenda catheters were significantly less likely to have disconnections (p < 0.001) and obstructions (p = 0.016), and overall were less likely to have any catheter-related complications (p = 0.01). Patients with preexisting VP shunts at the time of implantation had a significantly greater mean decrease in MAS scores in both their lower extremities (1.8, p = 0.003) and upper extremities (1.3, p = 0.002) than did patients without shunts. Various complications are associated with ITB therapy, most commonly catheter complications and pseudomeningoceles. There have been fewer catheter complications associated with the newest catheter model, while pseudomeningoceles have become less frequent since the surgical technique was modified to prevent them. VP shunts and G-tubes are not associated with significantly higher complication rates and shunts seem to be associated with greater efficacy of ITB therapy, as represented by a greater mean improvement in MAS scores."}, {"Title": "The Cancer Incidence and Trends From 2011 to 2018 in Ma'anshan, China: A Registry-Based Observational Study.", "PMID": "39303296", "Authors": ["Qin Q", "Min Y", "Xie Y", "Wang C", "Zhang Y", "Wu D", "Xu J", "Meng N", "Suo C"], "Source": "Cancer control : journal of the Moffitt Cancer Center", "PublicationDate": {"Year": "2024", "Season": "Jan-Dec"}, "Abstract": "The cancer burden in China has been increasing over the decades.

The study was designed to describe the cancer incidence and trends in Ma'anshan from 2011 to 2018, providing information about cancer etiology that is useful for prevention programs. The cancer incidence rate and age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) were calculated using the cancer registry data in Ma'anshan during 2011-2018. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) of the ASIR was analyzed by the Joinpoint regression analysis. Age, period, and cohort effects on cancer incidence were estimated through the age-period-cohort model. There were 13,508 newly diagnosed cancer cases in males and 9558 in females in Ma'anshan during 2011-2018. The ASIR maintained a steady trend in both males and females. Age effects showed that cancer risk increased with age in both genders; no visible period effects were detected during this study period. Cohort effects changed slowly until the end of the 1950s, then started decreasing in males while increasing in females after 1960. Lung, gastric, female breast, colorectal, cervical, esophageal, liver, thyroid, lymphoma, and pancreatic cancer were the most common cancers in Ma'anshan during the study period. The ASIR of gastric cancer (AAPC: -3.72%), esophageal cancer (AAPC: -8.30%), and liver cancer (AAPC: -5.55%) declined, while that of female breast cancer (AAPC: 3.91%), colorectal cancer (AAPC: 3.23%), and thyroid cancer (AAPC: 22.38%) rose. During 2011-2018, the cancer incidence in Ma'anshan was lower than that in China, nation-wide. The incidence of upper gastrointestinal cancer decreased gradually while female breast, colorectal, and thyroid cancers showed an upward trend, consistent with the changes in the cancer spectrum in China.

However, in Germany, digital health has not yet been systematically integrated into medical curricula and is taught in a relatively small number of electives. Challenges for lecturers include the dynamic field as well as lacking guidance on how to efficiently apply innovative teaching formats for these new digital competencies. Quality improvement projects provide options to pilot-test novel educational offerings, as little is known about the acceptability of participatory approaches in conventional medical education. This quality improvement project addressed the gap in medical school electives on digital health literacy by introducing and evaluating an elective scoping study on the systematic development of different health app concepts designed by students to cultivate essential skills for future health care professionals (ie, mobile health [mHealth] competencies). This proof-of-concept study describes the development, optimization, implementation, and evaluation of a web-based elective on digital (mental) health competencies in medical education. Implemented as part of a quality improvement project, the elective aimed to guide medical students in developing app concepts applying a design thinking approach at a German medical school from January 2021 to January 2024. Topics included defining digital (mental) health, quality criteria for health apps, user perspective, persuasive design, and critical reflection on digitization in medical practice. The elective was offered 6 times within 36 months, with continuous evaluation and iterative optimization using both process and outcome measures, such as web-based questionnaires. We present examples of app concepts designed by students and summarize the quantitative and qualitative evaluation results. In total, 60 students completed the elective and developed 25 health app concepts, most commonly targeting stress management and depression. In addition, disease management and prevention apps were designed for various somatic conditions such as diabetes and chronic pain. The results indicated high overall satisfaction across the 6 courses according to the evaluation questionnaire, with lower scores indicating higher satisfaction on a scale ranging from 1 to 6 (mean 1.70, SD 0.68). Students particularly valued the content, flexibility, support, and structure. While improvements in group work, submissions, and information transfer were suggested, the results underscore the usefulness of the web-based elective. This quality improvement project provides insights into relevant features for the successful user-centered and creative integration of mHealth competencies into medical education. Key factors for the satisfaction of students involved the participatory mindset, focus on competencies, discussions with app providers, and flexibility. Future efforts should define important learning objectives for digital health literacy and provide recommendations for integration rather than debating the need for digital health integration."}, {"Title": "The Development of an Electronic Medical Record System to Improve Quality of Care for Individuals With Type 1 Diabetes in Rwanda: Qualitative Study.", "PMID": "39303284", "Authors": ["Bille N", "Christensen DL", "Byberg S", "Calopietro M", "Gishoma C", "Villadsen SF"], "Source": "JMIR diabetes", "PublicationDate": {"Year": "2024", "Month": "Sep", "Day": "20"}, "Abstract": "Electronic medical record (EMR) systems have the potential to improve the quality of care and clinical outcomes for individuals with chronic and complex diseases.

It is essential for society to understand these needs and develop a more thoughtful approach to digital health care. This study aims to evaluate the behavioral intention and satisfaction of older adults with digital medical services by identifying the perceived factors and the pathways through which these factors influence their behavior. This study used a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses. A focus group interview was conducted with 30 randomly selected older adults, and the interviews were transcribed verbatim and coded using grounded theory. In addition, 876 valid questionnaires were collected to describe older adults' perceptions of and satisfaction with digital medical care. Then, t tests and ANOVA were used to explore differences among various demographic groups, while hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to identify the factors most closely related to satisfaction. Structural equation modeling was used to identify multiple mediating effects. The qualitative study identified the core category of \"medical service relief and transformation paths for older adults in the context of digital reform.\" Quantitative analysis revealed that more than half of the older adults were satisfied with digital medical services, and behavioral intentions were higher among those with higher incomes and education levels. Structural equation modeling confirmed that external variables, such as digital skills training, positively influenced perceived ease of use (\u03b2=.594, P<.001), perceived usefulness (\u03b2=.544, P<.001), and promoted digital medical behavioral intentions (\u03b2=.256, P<.001), while also reducing perceived risk (\u03b2=-.295, P<.001). Additionally, perceived ease of use (\u03b2=.168, P<.001) and perceived usefulness (\u03b2=.508, P<.001) positively impacted behavioral intention, whereas perceived risk (\u03b2=-.05, P=.037) exerted a negative influence. Furthermore, behavioral intention (\u03b2=.641, P<.001) significantly and positively affected older adults' satisfaction with digital medical care. The mediation test identified 4 significant paths: (1) external variables \u2192 perceived ease of use \u2192 behavioral intention (effect size of 13.9%); (2) external variables \u2192 perceived usefulness \u2192 behavioral intention (effect size of 38.4%); (3) external variables \u2192 perceived ease of use \u2192 perceived usefulness \u2192 behavioral intention (effect size of 10.1%); and (4) a direct effect (35.5%) from external variables to behavioral intention. Based on the study's findings, addressing the needs of older adults and enhancing perceived usefulness are the most effective ways to encourage the use of digital health care devices. Community support plays a crucial role in helping older adults integrate into digital health care, and adapting the design of services and products to suit their needs improves their perceptions of digital health care. This, in turn, promotes usage behavior and satisfaction, while the negative impact of perceived risk remains minimal."}], "semantic_scholar_results": null, "combined_summary": "### Summary of Recent Medical Research Papers\n\n1. **Intraoperative Venous Air Embolism in Neurosurgery**  \n   - **Study**: Analyzed 1000 neurosurgical cases in the lounging position.  \n   - **Findings**: VAE detected in 51.4% of patients; no permanent neurological deficits or fatalities linked to VAE.

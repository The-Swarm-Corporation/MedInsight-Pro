In medically underserved ED populations, we sought to determine (1) whether there are gaps in awareness and self-declared understanding about long COVID illness, and (2) the prevalence, impact on school/work attendance, and receipt of care for long COVID symptoms. This study was a cross-sectional, convenience sample survey study of adult patients at 11 geographically representative US EDs from December 2022 to October 2023. Awareness and self-declared understanding about long COVID illness were measured. Prevalence, impact on school/work attendance, and receipt of care for long COVID symptoms were also assessed. Of 1,618 eligible patients, 1455 (89.9%) agreed to participate, including 33.4% African Americans and 30.9% Latino/a. Of the patients, 17.1% lacked primary care. In total, 33.2% had persistent COVID-19 symptoms lasting >1 month, and 20.3% had symptoms >3 months. Moreover, 49.8% with long COVID symptoms missed work/school because of symptoms; 30.3% of all participants and 33.5% of participants who had long COVID symptoms had prior awareness and self-declared understanding of long COVID. Characteristics associated with poor understanding of long COVID were African American race (adjusted odds\u00a0ratio [aOR] 3.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66 to 5.09) and Latino/a ethnicity (aOR 3.16, 95% CI 2.15 to 4.64). Participants lacking primary care were less likely to have received long COVID care (24.6% versus 51.2%; difference 26.6%; 95% CI 13.7% to 36.9%). Despite high prevalence and impact on school/work attendance of long COVID symptoms, most of this ED population had limited awareness and self-declared understanding of long COVID, and many had not received care.

Therfore, It makes sense to test the clinical effect of AD against COVID-19 and Long COVID. On May 20, 2024, this systematic scoping review in PUBMED identified 1016 articles related to AD and COVID-19, Long COVID and SARS-COV-2. These included 10 retrospective \\\"large scale\\\" studies (> 20000 chart reviews), 8 prospective clinical trials (plus 4 regarding Long COVID), 11 placebo-controlled randomized (RCT) (plus 2 regarding Long COVID) and 15 meta-analyses. COVID-19: Retrospective studies with cohorts taking AD primarily for psychiatric comorbidities or chronic pain conditions directly prior to SARS-COV-2 infection described that this substance class (most studied: Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitors (SSRI) and Selective Serotonin Noradrenaline Re-Uptake Inhibitors (SSNRI)) were associated with (i) significantly fewer SARS-COV-2 infections and (ii) a milder course of COVID-19 (\\\"COVID-19 protection\\\"). Ten of the 11 RCTs found regarding COVID-19 tested fluvoxamine, as this old AD appeared suitable as a prophylactic agent against severe COVID-19, taking into account its in vitro potency against the progression of intracellular sepsis cascades. Therefore, most (12 out of 15) meta-analyses also referred to fluvoxamine. They found (iii) a significant (40-70% reduction) in mortality, intubation and hospitalization rates when fluvoxamine was used as an add-on to standard therapy for mild to moderate COVID-19. When this AD was used in the early stages of the disease, it was more successful than when it was given later in advanced, severe COVID-19 (e.g. severe pneumonia, final sepsis stages). A dose dependency was observed: 2x50 mg fluvoxamine over 15 days was less effective than 2x100 or even 3x100 mg with an adverse event profile still at the placebo level. Direct comparisons with drugs approved for COVID-19 do not yet exist. A first indirect meta-analytical comparison showed an advantage of paxlovid or molnupiravir versus fluvoxamine against the development of severe COVID-19: risk reduction of 95% (I2 = N/A, but only one study) or 78% (I2=0) versus 5+-5% (I2=48). However, an add-on of fluvoxamine was still significantly more efficacious than symptom-oriented standard therapy alone. Long COVID: A common Long COVID phenotype with dominant anxiety and depression symptoms, which responds to AD, relaxation therapy and/or psychotherapy, has now been identified. Casuistics report positive effects of AD on fatigue, cognitive and autonomic dysfunctions. A first large prospective open-label RCT has just shown significantly more favourable courses, less viral load and less pro-inflammatory cytokines in the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 with fluvoxamine versus standard treatment, also with regard to the subsequent development of neuropsychiatric and pulmonary Long COVID or fatigue. Overall, there is promising evidence of a preventive effect of AD (especially fluvoxamine) against progression to severe COVID-19 and against the development of Long COVID. It is likely, that the entire AD substance class could be effective here. This assumption is based on the results of retrospective large scale studies, but awaits verification by better controlled studies. The potential effectiveness/efficacy (currently low and moderate confidence of the evidence for the entire substance class and specifically fluvoxamine, respectively) of fluvoxamine as an add-on against COVID-19 and possibly also directly against Long COVID could stimulate similar projects in other infectious diseases that also have the potential to pose a lasting threat to the health of those affected. We consider the evidence to date to be sufficient to be able to emphasize a possible positive effect of these substances in the psychoeducation of patients with COVID-19 or Long COVID who are already receiving AD for other conditions - especially also against the symptoms associated with the viral disease or its consequences. In regions where neither vaccines nor antiviral agents currently approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 are available, AD and in particular fluvoxamine would be a cost-effective alternative to protect against a severe course, even if this AD appears to have a smaller effect against COVID-19 than the currently approved antiviral agents, but with presumably better tolerability. A direct comparative clinical trial with approved antiviral agents is still pending and should be positive to further open the door for a guideline-based recommendation of fluvoxamine (or perhaps even AD) for COVID-19 or its aftermath.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Title\": \"Advance in the mechanism and clinical research of myalgia in long COVID.\",\n                    \"PMID\": \"39310121\",\n                    \"Authors\": [\n                        \"Zhai X\",\n                        \"Wu W\",\n                        \"Zeng S\",\n                        \"Miao Y\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Source\": \"American journal of clinical and experimental immunology\",\n                    \"PublicationDate\": {\n                        \"Year\": \"2024\"\n                    },\n                    \"Abstract\": \"As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to evolve, mortality rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have significantly decreased.

Currently, there is limited research on the skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. In this brief review, we review potential pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID, and summarize the various auxiliary examinations and treatments for skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. We consider abnormal activation of inflammatory response, myopathy, and neurological damages as pivotal pathological mechanisms of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID. A comprehensive examination is significantly important in order to work out effective treatment plans and relieve skeletal muscle pain. So far, rehabilitation interventions for myalgia in long COVID contain but are not limited to drug, nutraceutical therapy, gut microbiome-targeted therapy, interventional therapy and strength training. Our study provides a potential mechanism reference for clinical researches, highlighting the importance of comprehensive approach and management of skeletal muscle pain in long COVID.

However, accumulating data suggests that COVID-19 is a systemic microvascular endothelial dysfunction with different clinical manifestations. In this study, a microvascular function was assessed in long COVID patients (n\u00a0=\u00a033) and healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a030) using flow-mediated skin fluorescence technique (FMSF), based on measurements of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fluorescence intensity during brachial artery occlusion (ischemic response, IR) and immediately after occlusion (hyperemic response, HR). Microcirculatory function readings were taken twice, 3\u00a0months apart. In addition, we quantified biochemical markers such as the serum L-arginine derivatives and hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) to assess their relation with microvascular parameters evaluated in vivo. In patients with long COVID, serum HIF1\u03b1 was significantly correlated to IR<sub>index</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.375, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Similarly, there was a significant inverse correlation of serum asymmetric dimethyl-L-arginine levels to both HR<sub>max</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.343, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and HR<sub>index</sub> (r\u00a0=\u00a0-0.335, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The IR parameters were found lower or negative in long COVID patients and recovered in three-month follow-up. Hypoxia sensitivity value was significantly higher in long COVID patients examined after three months of treatment based on the combination of ACE-inhibitors and beta-adrenolytic compared to baseline condition (85.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a073.8 vs. 39.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a051.7 respectively, p\u00a0=\u00a00.009). This study provides evidence that FMSF is a sensitive, non-invasive technique to track changes in microvascular function that was impaired in long COVID and recovered after 3\u00a0months, especially in patients receiving a cardioprotective therapy.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Title\": \"Long COVID or Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection (PASC) and the Urgent Need to Identify Diagnostic Biomarkers and Risk Factors.\",\n                    \"PMID\": \"39289865\",\n                    \"Authors\": [\n                        \"Parums DV\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Source\": \"Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research\",\n                    \"PublicationDate\": {\n                        \"Year\": \"2024\",\n                        \"Month\": \"Sep\",\n                        \"Day\": \"18\"\n                    },\n                    \"Abstract\": \"Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition or post-COVID syndrome, can affect anyone infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or the severity of the initial symptoms of COVID-19. Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10-20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath. However, more than 200 symptoms have been reported. No phenotypic or diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for developing long COVID/PASC, which is a multisystem disorder that can present with isolated or combined respiratory, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no cure. Therefore, individualized patient management requires a multidisciplinary clinical approach. Because millions of people have had and continue to have COVID-19, even in the era of vaccination and antiviral therapies, long COVID/PASC is now and will increasingly become a health and economic burden that the world must prepare for. Almost five years from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article aims to review what is currently known about long COVID/PASC, the anticipated increasing global health burden, and why there is still an urgent need to identify diagnostic biomarkers and risk factors to improve prevention and treatment.\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"Title\": \"A prospective non-randomized controlled trial testing the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic inpatient treatment of Post-COVID-19 syndrome - study protocol.\",\n                    \"PMID\": \"39285491\",\n                    \"Authors\": [\n                        \"Koller K\",\n                        \"Kastel-Hoffmann S\",\n                        \"Herold R\",\n                        \"Morawa E\",\n                        \"Lieb M\",\n                        \"Krehbiel J\",\n                        \"Hohberger B\",\n                        \"Erim Y\"\n                    ],\n                    \"Source\": \"BMC psychology\",\n                    \"PublicationDate\": {\n                        \"Year\": \"2024\",\n                        \"Month\": \"Sep\",\n                        \"Day\": \"16\"\n                    },\n                    \"Abstract\": \"In addition to physical symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and pain, a subgroup of patients with Post-COVID-19 syndrome (Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19, PASC) suffers from mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive impairments. To date, there are no causal treatments available for PASC. While initial studies show that psychotherapy improves psychological symptoms, PASC-related fatigue, and psychosocial functioning, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic treatment for PASC. This study presents a non-randomized controlled trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of a five-week multimodal inpatient psychosomatic treatment program for individuals experiencing PASC symptoms and comorbid mental illness. A total of 118 patients presented at the Post-COVID Center at the Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Erlangen will be assigned to the intervention group receiving inpatient psychosomatic treatment or the control group receiving treatment as usual. The inclusion criteria for the intervention group are a diagnosis of PASC and at least one condition of mental distress and problems with coping with illness. The primary objective of the intervention is to reduce mental ailments, including depression and anxiety, as well as neurocognitive deficits, and to address PASC symptoms such as fatigue and pain. The core elements of the treatment are psychotherapy in individual and group settings, medical treatment, neurocognitive training, and physical therapy, adapted to the individual's capacity and oriented towards the concept of pacing. After enrollment, participants will undergo a 6-month follow-up to assess long-term results and the sustainability of the intervention effects. This study examines the effectiveness of inpatient psychotherapeutic treatment in PASC patients with comorbid mental illness in comparison with a control group based on treatment as usual. The results of the study can contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions to address the complex needs of patients with PASC and comorbid mental illness.

                "Abstract": "Long COVID, or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as post-COVID-19 condition or post-COVID syndrome, can affect anyone infected with SARS-CoV-2, regardless of age or the severity of the initial symptoms of COVID-19. Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10-20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath. However, more than 200 symptoms have been reported. No phenotypic or diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for developing long COVID/PASC, which is a multisystem disorder that can present with isolated or combined respiratory, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no cure. Therefore, individualized patient management requires a multidisciplinary clinical approach. Because millions of people have had and continue to have COVID-19, even in the era of vaccination and antiviral therapies, long COVID/PASC is now and will increasingly become a health and economic burden that the world must prepare for. Almost five years from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article aims to review what is currently known about long COVID/PASC, the anticipated increasing global health burden, and why there is still an urgent need to identify diagnostic biomarkers and risk factors to improve prevention and treatment."

                "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a substantial global health crisis, with effects extending far beyond the acute phase of infection. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the long-term cardiovascular impact of COVID-19, focusing on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and future research directions. SARS-CoV-2 induces cardiovascular complications through mechanisms such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and direct myocardial injury, leading to conditions like myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. These long-term effects, collectively called \"long COVID\" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), present significant challenges for healthcare systems and patient management. Diagnostic approaches include imaging techniques and laboratory tests to identify and monitor cardiovascular complications. Management strategies emphasize a holistic approach, incorporating pharmacological treatments and lifestyle modifications. Special attention is required for vulnerable populations, including those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Ongoing research is essential to understand the full spectrum of long-term cardiovascular impacts and to develop effective treatments. This review highlights the critical need for continued vigilance, multidisciplinary care, and research to address the cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and improve long-term health outcomes for survivors."

                "Abstract": "Long COVID is a common sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data from numerous scientific studies indicate that long COVID involves a complex interaction between pathophysiological processes. Long COVID may involve the development of new diagnosable health conditions and exacerbation of pre-existing health conditions. However, despite this rapidly accumulating body of evidence regarding the pathobiology of long COVID, psychogenic and functional interpretations of the illness presentation continue to be endorsed by some healthcare professionals, creating confusion and inappropriate diagnostic and therapeutic pathways for people living with long COVID. The purpose of this perspective is to present a clinical and scientific rationale for why long COVID should not be considered as a functional neurologic disorder. It will begin by discussing the parallel historical development of pathobiological and psychosomatic/sociogenic diagnostic constructs arising from a common root in neurasthenia, which has resulted in the collective understandings of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and functional neurologic disorder (FND), respectively. We will also review the case definition criteria for FND and the distinguishing clinical and neuroimaging findings in FND vs. long COVID. We conclude that considering long COVID as FND is inappropriate based on differentiating pathophysiologic mechanisms and distinguishing clinical findings."

                "Abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has arguably had its greatest impact in rural and other historically hard-to-reach populations. Families in rural and underserved communities experienced COVID-19 infections at higher rate than their peers in other groups and also experienced disproportionate morbidity and mortality. Without careful design and implementation of resources, children in these areas are also at risk of being disproportionately impacted by long-term sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infections, such as \"Long COVID\" syndromes. Increased frequency and severity of COVID-19 infections; decreased access to healthcare and supporting services; environmental and social structure factors that exacerbate post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC); and increased baseline frequency of health disorders that may complicate post-COVID issues, such as higher rates of obesity, asthma, diabetes, and mental health disorders all place children and adolescents in under-resourced areas at significant risk. Unfortunately, children and adolescents in these areas have been historically underrepresented in clinical research. Not only are fewer studies published with participants in rural and underserved communities, but these studies more often exhibit lower quality with fewer randomized controlled trials and multicenter studies. This gap not only deprives people in rural and underserved areas of the country of access to cutting edge therapy; but it also risks \"evidence-based\" solutions that are not generalizable because they cannot be implemented in the areas disproportionately impacted by many health conditions such as Long COVID. These factors significantly impede our ability to provide appropriate medical care for underserved communities. This review will discuss the impact of COVID-19 in rural and underserved communities and the factors that must be considered in designing evidence-based Long COVID solutions for children and adolescents in these areas."

                "Abstract": "As the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic progressed, some survivors noted prolonged symptoms following acute infection, termed post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) or \"long COVID.\" PASC is a significant clinical and public health concern that adversely impacts patients' quality of life, income, and health care expenses. PASC symptoms are highly heterogenous, the most common being fatigue and cognitive impairment, and they likely reflect a spectrum of clinical phenotypes. The proposed role of persistent inflammation is one of leading pathophysiological theories. This review article addresses these proposed mechanisms of persistent and aberrant inflammation, their clinical evaluation and theoretical approaches to management. A review of public databases was used to collect literature for the review. The literature supports a prominent role of persistent and aberrant inflammation as a major contributor to the symptoms of PASC. Proposed mechanisms for persistent inflammation include reactivation of latent viruses, viral persistence, loss of immunoregulatory pathways, autoimmune mechanisms, and/or mast cell dysregulation. Persistent inflammation may result in constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, brain fog, body aches, and/or organ specific dysfunction such as gastrointestinal dysregulation, myocardial inflammation and others. There are no approved or even proven therapies for PASC at this time, but some studies have identified therapeutic options that may either reduce the risk for progression to PASC or decrease symptom burden. Laboratory evaluation and therapeutic options are limited and require further investigation to establish their clinical value. A more refined definition of PASC is needed to address the wide variety of clinical presentations, pathophysiology, and therapeutic options."

                "Abstract": "Long COVID is a complex, multisystem illness with a poorly understood pathophysiology, absence of specific diagnostic tests or criteria, or evidence-based treatments. With over 200 identified symptoms and approximately 10% of COVID-19 cases resulting in Long COVID, it is a challenge to provide comprehensive treatment at a scale commensurate with the illness burden. The diverse manifestations of Long COVID, encompassing numerous medical specialties, typically place primary care providers (PCPs) at the forefront of management, navigating an evolving landscape of research and lack of evidence-based guidelines. This paper presents a pragmatic, structured framework for Long COVID management in primary care, integrating current knowledge and best practices. The approach is individualized, addressing Long COVID's broad symptomatology through a four-step framework. The first step focuses on energy management strategies, emphasizing the prevention of post-exertional malaise, a cardinal feature of Long COVID. The second step, intentional rehabilitation, employs carefully titrated multidisciplinary modalities to address physical, cognitive, and emotional domains. The third step utilizes symptomatic management through both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions, targeting debilitating symptoms like fatigue, insomnia, and chronic pain. The fourth step outlines an approach to trialing experimental, targeted therapies that may impact Long COVID's underlying pathophysiology. These treatments, while experimental and lacking quality evidence in Long COVID, may be available off-label on an individual basis following a thorough risk-benefit discussion. This stepwise framework can equip PCPs to effectively address the most common and disabling symptoms of Long COVID, individualize care, and remain attuned to the evolving scientific understanding of the condition."

This prospective randomized controlled study was conducted in a hospital in China. The effect of intermittent hypoxia exposure (IHE; 5-min hypoxia alternating with 5-min normal air, repeated five times) on dyspnea and fatigue was investigated in patients meeting the NICE definition of PASC. Patients were computationally randomized to receive normoxia exposure (NE) and routine therapy or IHE and routine therapy. Six-minute walk distance (6MWD) and spirometry were tested before and after the interventions; the Borg Dyspnea Scale (Borg) and the modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC) were used to assess dyspnea; and the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) and the Chalder Fatigue Scale-11 (CFQ-11) were used to assess fatigue. The study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2300070565). Ninety-five participants (33 males and 62 females) were recruited between March 1, 2023 and December 30, 2023. Forty-seven patients in the IHE group received 10.0 (9.0, 15.0) days of IHE, and 48 patients in NE group received 10.0 (8.0, 12.0) days of NE. 6MWD, forced vital capacity (FVC), FVC %pred, forced expiratory volume in 1\u00a0s (FEV<sub>1</sub>), FEV<sub>1</sub> %pred, tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>), and dyspnea and fatigue scales markedly improved after IHE (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and improvements were greater than in the NE group (all p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Furthermore, participants in IHE group had better subjective improvements in dyspnea and fatigue than those in the NE group (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with <10 days of IHE, \u226510 days of IHE had a greater impact on 6MWD, FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub> %pred, V<sub>T</sub>, FAS, and CFQ-11. No severe adverse events were reported. IHE improved spirometry and 6MWD and relieved dyspnea and fatigue in PASC patients. Larger prospective studies are now needed to verify these findings."

Electrical stimulation (E-Stim) to the gastrocnemius muscle can enhance strength outcomes by increasing the frequency of muscle fiber activation. We investigated its effect on individuals with PASC. Participants were randomized into intervention (IG) or control (CG) groups. The IG self-administered daily one-hour E-Stim to both their gastrocnemius muscles using a functional device over 4-week, while the CG used a sham device. Primary outcomes were ankle dorsiflexion strength assessed via dynamometry during maximum voluntary contractions, and gastrocnemius voluntary activation (GVA) via surface electromyography. The secondary outcome assessed activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL, and mobility queries. Percentage improvement was calculated. Eighteen patients were analyzed (IG\u2009=\u200910; CG\u2009=\u20098). After 4\u00a0week, the IG showed a significantly higher improvement in ankle dorsiflexion strength (222.64%) compared to the CG (51.27%, p\u2009=\u20090.002). Additionally, the IG's ankle dorsiflexion strength improvement significantly correlated with GVA improvement (rho\u2009=\u20090.782) at 4\u00a0week. The secondary outcomes did not reveal significant changes in neither group. Self-administered gastrocnemius E-Stim improves ankle dorsiflexion strength in individuals with PASC. However, larger sample sizes and longer interventions are needed to validate these findings."

These CoVs have caused a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to severe distress syndromes (ARDS), resulting in high morbidity and mortality. The accelerated advancements in antiviral drug discovery, spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, have shed new light on the imperative to develop treatments effective against a broad spectrum of CoVs. This perspective discusses strategies and lessons learnt in targeting viral non-structural proteins, structural proteins, drug repurposing, and combinational approaches for the development of antivirals against CoVs. Drawing lessons from the pandemic, it becomes evident that the absence of efficient broad-spectrum antiviral drugs increases the vulnerability of public health systems to the potential onslaught by highly pathogenic CoVs. The rapid and sustained spread of novel CoVs can have devastating consequences without effective and specifically targeted treatments. Prioritizing the effective development of broad-spectrum antivirals is imperative for bolstering the resilience of public health systems and mitigating the potential impact of future highly pathogenic CoVs."

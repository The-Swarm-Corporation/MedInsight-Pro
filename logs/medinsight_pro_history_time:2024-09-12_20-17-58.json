This study was a planned secondary analysis of a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial (The CHAP [Chronic Hypertension and Pregnancy] trial). Pregnant participants with mild chronic hypertension (BP below 160/105 mm Hg) were randomized into two groups: active (antihypertensive treatment) or control (no treatment unless severe hypertension, BP 160/105 mm Hg or higher). Study outcomes were BP control below 140/90 mm Hg (primary) and medication nonadherence based on a composite score threshold (secondary) at the 6-week postpartum follow-up visit. Participants without follow-up BP measurements were excluded from analysis of the BP control outcome. Participants without health care professional-prescribed antihypertensives at delivery were excluded from the analysis of the adherence outcome. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders. Of 2,408 participants, 1,684 (864 active, 820 control) were included in the analysis. A greater percentage of participants in the active group achieved BP control (56.7% vs 51.5%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.22, 95% CI, 1.00-1.48) than in the control group. Postpartum antihypertensive prescription was higher in the active group (81.7% vs 58.4%, P<.001), and nonadherence did not differ significantly between groups (aOR 0.81, 95% CI, 0.64-1.03). Antihypertensive treatment of mild chronic hypertension during pregnancy was associated with better BP control below 140/90 mm Hg in the immediate postpartum period."

High-speed sharing and the relentless activity of social media influencers have made this difficult problem even worse. Dangerous skepticism about the COVID-19 vaccine, for example, continues to stoke wider hesitancy to other vaccines, a disastrous consequence for public health. Solutions to blunt scientific misinformation have been elusive. Now a new study, reported in this issue of <i>Science</i>, suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a means to dispel misinformation and in a way that lasts."

                "Abstract": "Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has proved ineffective in treating patients hospitalised with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), but uncertainty remains over its safety and efficacy in chemoprevention. Previous chemoprevention randomised controlled trials (RCTs) did not individually show benefit of HCQ against COVID-19 and, although meta-analysis did suggest clinical benefit, guidelines recommend against its use. Healthy adult participants from the healthcare setting, and later from the community, were enrolled in 26 centres in 11 countries to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised trial of COVID-19 chemoprevention. HCQ was evaluated in Europe and Africa, and chloroquine (CQ) was evaluated in Asia, (both base equivalent of 155 mg once daily). The primary endpoint was symptomatic COVID-19, confirmed by PCR or seroconversion during the 3-month follow-up period. The secondary and tertiary endpoints were: asymptomatic laboratory-confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection; severity of COVID-19 symptoms; all-cause PCR-confirmed symptomatic acute respiratory illness (including SARS-CoV-2 infection); participant reported number of workdays lost; genetic and baseline biochemical markers associated with symptomatic COVID-19, respiratory illness and disease severity (not reported here); and health economic analyses of HCQ and CQ prophylaxis on costs and quality of life measures (not reported here). The primary and safety analyses were conducted in the intention-to-treat (ITT) population. Recruitment of 40,000 (20,000 HCQ arm, 20,000 CQ arm) participants was planned but was not possible because of protracted delays resulting from controversies over efficacy and adverse events with HCQ use, vaccine rollout in some countries, and other factors. Between 29 April 2020 and 10 March 2022, 4,652 participants (46% females) were enrolled (HCQ/CQ n = 2,320; placebo n = 2,332). The median (IQR) age was 29 (23 to 39) years. SARS-CoV-2 infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) occurred in 1,071 (23%) participants. For the primary endpoint the incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 was 240/2,320 in the HCQ/CQ versus 284/2,332 in the placebo arms (risk ratio (RR) 0.85 [95% confidence interval, 0.72 to 1.00; p = 0.05]). For the secondary and tertiary outcomes asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections occurred in 11.5% of HCQ/CQ recipients and 12.0% of placebo recipients: RR: 0.96 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.12; p = 0.6). There were no differences in the severity of symptoms between the groups and no severe illnesses. HCQ/CQ chemoprevention was associated with fewer PCR-confirmed all-cause respiratory infections (predominantly SARS-CoV-2): RR 0.61 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.88; p = 0.009) and fewer days lost to work because of illness: 104 days per 1,000 participants over 90 days (95% CI, 12 to 199 days; p < 0.001). The prespecified meta-analysis of all published pre-exposure RCTs indicates that HCQ/CQ prophylaxis provided a moderate protective benefit against symptomatic COVID-19: RR 0.80 (95% CI, 0.71 to 0.91). Both drugs were well tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events (SAEs). Study limitations include the smaller than planned study size, the relatively low number of PCR-confirmed infections, and the lower comparative accuracy of serology endpoints (in particular, the adapted dried blood spot method) compared to the PCR endpoint. The COPCOV trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov; number NCT04303507. In this large placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised trial, HCQ and CQ were safe and well tolerated in COVID-19 chemoprevention, and there was evidence of moderate protective benefit in a meta-analysis including this trial and similar RCTs. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04303507; ISRCTN Registry ISRCTN10207947."

                "Abstract": "Arguments over the appropriate Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) for public health emergencies often assume that there is a tradeoff between saving the most lives, saving the most life-years, and preventing racial disparities. However, these assumptions have rarely been explored empirically. To quantitatively characterize possible ethical tradeoffs, we aimed to simulate the implementation of five proposed CSC protocols for rationing ventilators in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. A Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the number of lives saved and life-years saved by implementing clinical acuity-, comorbidity- and age-based CSC protocols under different shortage conditions. This model was populated with patient data from 3707 adult admissions requiring ventilator support in a New York hospital system between April 2020 and May 2021. To estimate lives and life-years saved by each protocol, we determined survival to discharge and estimated remaining life expectancy for each admission. The simulation demonstrated stronger performance for age-sensitive protocols. For a capacity of 1 bed per 2 patients, ranking by age bands saves approximately 29 lives and 3400 life-years per thousand patients. Proposed protocols from New York and Maryland which allocated without considering age saved the fewest lives (~13.2 and 8.5 lives) and life-years (~416 and 420 years). Unlike other protocols, the New York and Maryland algorithms did not generate significant disparities in lives saved and life-years saved between White non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic sub-populations. For all protocols, we observed a positive correlation between lives saved and life-years saved, but also between lives saved overall and inequality in the number of lives saved in different race and ethnicity sub-populations. While there is significant variance in the number of lives saved and life-years saved, we did not find a tradeoff between saving the most lives and saving the most life-years. Moreover, concerns about racial discrimination in triage protocols require thinking carefully about the tradeoff between enforcing equality of survival rates and maximizing the lives saved in each sub-population."

                "Abstract": "Experiencing 27% of the global tuberculosis (TB) burden, India's TB epidemic is the largest in the world. Due to COVID-19-related disruptions to TB programs, India has also seen the largest drop in TB case notifications of any country globally. We estimated case fatality among people treated for TB in India during the pandemic and compared these to pre-pandemic estimates. A random sample of 4,000 adults enrolled in World Health Partners (WHP), a private sector TB treatment support program (enrolling only people with drug-susceptible TB) in Bihar, India in the first year of COVID-19 (Mar 2020-Mar 2021) were contacted via phone to collect information on TB case fatality and other relevant covariates. Inverse probability of selection (IPS) weighting was used to obtain selection-bias-corrected in-treatment and post-treatment case fatality estimates. Covariates associated with (but not necessarily causal of) case fatality were identified by estimating adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) using the Cox proportional hazards model. WHP enrolled 19,826 adult drug-susceptible TB patients in the first year of COVID-19 (Mar 2020 to Mar 2021). Of our random sample of 4,000 patients, n = 2,962 (74.1%) answered the follow-up call. Unweighted and IPS-weighted in-treatment case fatality in the primary analysis were 6.12% (95%CI: 5.31-6.97%) and 6.07% (95%CI: 5.22-6.93%), respectively. Post-treatment case fatality estimates were 0.97% (95%CI: 0.61-1.33%) (unweighted) and 1.27% (95%CI: 0.79-1.79) (IPS-weighted). Our IPS-weighted estimates for in-treatment and post-treatment case fatality were similar to pre-pandemic IPS-weighted estimates (in-treatment: 7.27%, 95%CI: 5.97%- 8.49% and 12 months post-treatment: 1.23, 95%CI: 0.75-1.73). Although not higher than pre-pandemic estimates, the observed case fatality in this private sector cohort of people treated for drug-susceptible TB during COVID-19 in Bihar, India is above the level needed to reach the 2025 and 2030 End TB Strategy targets for reductions in TB deaths, underlining the extent of pandemic-related setbacks to TB elimination."

                "Abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of aerosol transmission and the importance of superspreading events. We analyzed a choir rehearsal in November 2020, where all participants, except one who had recently earlier recovered from COVID-19, were infected. We explore the risk factors for severe disease in this event and model the aerosol dispersion in the rehearsal room. Characteristics of participants were collected by interviews and supplemented with patient records. A computational simulation of aerosol distribution in the rehearsal room and the efficacy of potential safety measures was conducted using the Large-Eddy Simulation approach. Infection risk was studied by analyzing quanta emission and exposure with the Wells-Riley equation. The simulation showed that airborne transmission likely explains this mass contagion event. Every singer was exposed to the virus in only 5 min from the beginning of the rehearsal, and maximum concentration levels were reached at 20 min the concentration levels started to approach a steady state after 20 min. Although concentration differences existed in the room, risk levels near (1 m) and far (5 m) from the aerosol source were similar for certain singers. Modeling indicated infection risk levels of 70-100% after one hour; the risk would have been considerably reduced by wearing high-filtration respirators. Age and pre-existing comorbidities predicted more severe disease. The high incidence of illness may be partly attributed to the relatively high median age of individuals. Additionally, those admitted to the hospital had multiple underlying health conditions that predispose them to more severe disease. Airborne transmission and indoor space can explain this mass exposure event. High-filtration respirators could have prevented some infections. The importance of safety distances diminishes the longer the indoor event. The concept of safety distance is challenging, as our study suggests that long range airborne transmission may occur in indoor events with extended duration. We encourage informing the public, especially persons at risk, of safety measures during epidemics."

                "Abstract": "On June 17, 2024, the Food and Drug Administration approved 21-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) (PCV21; CAPVAXIVE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) for adults aged \u226518 years. PCV21 does not contain certain serotypes that are included in other licensed pneumococcal vaccines but adds eight new serotypes. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends use of a PCV for all adults aged \u226565 years, as well as adults aged 19-64 years with certain risk conditions for pneumococcal disease if they have not received a PCV or whose vaccination history is unknown. Previously, options included either 20-valent PCV (PCV20; Prevnar20; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) alone or a 15-valent PCV (PCV15; VAXNEUVANCE; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC) in series with 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23; Pneumovax23; Merck Sharp & Dohme, LLC). Additional recommendations for use of PCV20 exist for adults who started their pneumococcal vaccination series with 13-valent PCV (PCV13; Prevnar13; Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The ACIP Pneumococcal Vaccines Work Group employed the Evidence to Recommendations framework to guide its deliberations on PCV21 vaccination among U.S. adults. On June 27, 2024, ACIP recommended a single dose of PCV21 as an option for adults aged \u226519 years for whom PCV is currently recommended. Indications for PCV have not changed from previous recommendations. This report summarizes evidence considered for these recommendations and provides clinical guidance for use of PCV21."

                "Abstract": "Resilience Hubs provide mental health screening, facilitation of access and direct provision of psychosocial support for health and social care keyworkers in England affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To explore implementation of the Hubs, including characteristics of staff using the services, support accessed, costing data and a range of stakeholder perspectives on the barriers and enablers to Hub use and implementation of staff well-being support within the context of the pandemic. Mixed-methods evaluation. Four Resilience Hubs. Findings were integrated via mixed-method case studies, including: analyses of Hub mental health screening (<i>N</i> = 1973); follow-up questionnaire data (<i>N</i> = 299) on service use and health status of Hub clients; economic information provided by the Hubs; 63 interviews with Hub staff, wider stakeholders, Hub clients and keyworkers who did not use the Hubs. Findings were consistent across Hubs and workstreams. Most Hub clients were NHS staff. Under-represented groups included men, keyworkers from minority ethnic communities, care homes and emergency services staff. Clients reported comorbid mental health needs across multiple domains (anxiety; depression; post-traumatic stress; alcohol use; functioning). Their health status was lower than population norms and relevant pre-pandemic data. Several factors predicted higher needs, but having pre-pandemic emotional well-being concerns was one of the most robust predictors of higher need. Sixty per cent of participants who completed follow-up questionnaires reported receiving mental health support since Hub screening, most of which was directly or indirectly due to Hub support. High levels of satisfaction were reported. As in many services, staffing was the central component of Hub cost. Hubs were predominantly staffed by senior clinicians; this staffing model was consistent with the generally severe difficulties experienced by clients and the need for systemic/team-based working. Costs associated with health and social care use for Hub clients were low, which may be due to barriers to accessing support in general. Enablers to accessing Hubs included: a clear understanding of the Hubs, how to self-refer, and managerial support. Barriers included confusion between Hubs and other support; unhelpful beliefs about job roles, unsupportive managers, negative workplace cultures and difficulties caused by systemic issues. Some keyworkers highlighted a perceived need for further diversity and cultural competency training to improve reach to under-represented communities. Other barriers for these groups included prior negative experiences of services, structural inequalities and stigma. Some wider stakeholders had concerns around growing waiting times for Hub-provided therapy, and insufficient data on Hub usage and outcomes. Feedback was otherwise very positive. Main limitations included lack of comparative and pre-pandemic/baseline data, small numbers from under-represented groups limiting fine-grained analysis, and participant self-selection. Findings highlighted the value of the Hub model of outreach, screening, support navigation and provision of direct support during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and as a potential model to respond to future crises. The research provided recommendations to improve Hub promotion, equality/diversity/inclusion access issues, management of specialist resources and collection of relevant data on Hub outcomes and activities. Broader recommendations for the primary prevention of mental health difficulties across the health and care system are made, as individual support offers should be an adjunct to, not a replacement for, resolutions to systemic challenges. Research recommendations are made to conduct more robust evaluations of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the Hubs, using larger data sets and comparative data.

                "Abstract": "Public health strategies have focused on preventing and slowing the transmission of COVID-19 by promoting the uptake of mitigation strategies. However, little is known about the uptake of these strategies in the presence of underlying health conditions. To describe the attitudes and behaviours of a sample of Australians towards COVID-19 mitigation strategies, and determine if uptake of these strategies differed across different health conditions. Cross-sectional study. National survey of Australian residents over 18 years. A purpose-built survey was used to collect participants' attitudes and behaviours towards COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Over half (53%) of the 2867 participants (99% completion rate) reported having one or more comorbidities. The most commonly self-reported health condition was cardiometabolic conditions (28%). Most participants disagreed that masks were no longer needed (74%) and wanted the 5-day isolation mandate (66%). More than one-third would like masks to be mandated for indoor spaces (38%) and 25% avoided going to hospitals. Participants with allergies (OR 1.37; 95% CI 1.14, 1.65), cardiometabolic (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.23, 1.79), respiratory (OR 1.32; 95% CI 1.07, 1.62) and neurological (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.12, 2.32) conditions were more likely to avoid using public transport compared to those without. In contrast, participants with underlying mental health conditions were less likely to use N95/P2 facemasks in public spaces (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.25, 0.87) compared to those without. A substantial proportion of Australians continued to adopt COVID-19 mitigation measures or expressed a desire for more mitigations, including mandatory isolation for COVID-19, despite the lack of mandates. People with an underlying health condition who represent more than half of all adults appear to be more careful with mitigations to avoid COVID-19. Members of the public were invited to participate in a soft launch of the survey between 4th and 5th January 2023 to test flow and functionality, and to allow the final wording of survey questions to be refined as required."

                "Abstract": "Communities of Practice (CoP) were created to up-skill educators and to mitigate the disruption to physical therapist assistant (PTA) education because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding CoP involves considering individuals and their interactions, making this project significant for pioneering CoP among PTA educators, and using social network analysis (SNA). The research question for this mixed-methods concurrent triangulation study was \"To what extent did the network structure of virtual CoP reflect PTA educators' perceptions of participation and mentorship?\" Forty of 60 CoP members participated in this study. We analyzed 8 virtual PTA educator CoP that met over 4 months. Study participants completed a questionnaire about their experiences, engagement, and network connections. Individual and group-level friendship and mentorship network measures were studied using SNA. Qualitative responses were analyzed using the case study design approach. All results were integrated to draw out the complexity of the PTA educator CoP. There was high engagement, with 97.5% (n = 39) reporting they would participate again, and 80% (n = 32) resolved an immediate issue affecting their role. Moreover, 92.5% (n = 37) reported a perception of encouragement with the environment. Study participants reported being mentored by an average of 1.2 individuals (median 0, range 0-5) and serving as mentors to an average of 1.4 individuals (median 0, range 0-7). Two themes, unity and knowledge, emerged through the qualitative analysis. Participation by PTA educators in CoP, whether focused on administration, teaching methods, or clinical education, brings valuable outcomes. Our research supports existing literature in physical therapy education. We discovered that participant engagement, nurturing mentor relationships, encouraging knowledge sharing, and promoting a sense of unity among educators are all important factors."

                "Abstract": "Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) strain. Many anticancer compounds have been repurposed as effective anti-coronavirus agents and are currently in a clinical trial to be evaluated for treatment. Elacestrant is a novel selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD). A fingerprint Tanimoto-based 2-dimensional similarity search was performed in the PubChem database using elacestrant as a prototype. The chemical compounds were downloaded, and virtual screening, molecular docking, and molecular dynamics were further used to identify the most active molecules in the binding pocket SARS-COV-2 main protease. Eight compounds with superior docking score, gscore, and glide binding energy were identified. Molecular dynamic simulations (MD) were performed at 100\u2009ns to remove the false interactions between the receptor and the active ligands. The results showed that all the compounds displayed good stability. Further, the ADMET results showed that compounds CID58023104 was observed to be deemed a hit compound; hence, CID58023104 and could be optimize, derivatize, and explore for further development as an anti-coronavirus agent targeting SARS-COV-2 main protease."

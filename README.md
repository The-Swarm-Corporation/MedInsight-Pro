```

### API Keys Setup
MedInsight Pro requires access to the OpenAI API, PubMed, and Semantic Scholar APIs. You’ll need to set up environment variables for these keys:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export PUBMED_API_KEY="your-pubmed-api-key"  # Optional, but increases rate limits
export SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="your-semantic-scholar-api-key"
```

### Usage

```python
from medinsight_pro import MedInsightPro

# Initialize the MedInsight Pro agent
agent = MedInsightPro()

# Run a query to summarize the latest medical research on COVID-19 treatments
output = agent.run(query="COVID-19 treatments")
print(output)
```

### Integration
MedInsight Pro can be easily integrated with existing medical research platforms and enterprise applications:

- **PubMed Integration**: Automatically fetches and processes research papers from PubMed.
- **Semantic Scholar Integration**: Retrieves and summarizes the latest relevant papers from Semantic Scholar.
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Scale the agent to handle thousands of papers with built-in configuration for API rate limits and retries.

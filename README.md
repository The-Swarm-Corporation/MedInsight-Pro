### API Keys Setup
MedInsight Pro requires access to the OpenAI API, PubMed, and Semantic Scholar APIs. Youâ€™ll need to set up environment variables for these keys in your .env file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
PUBMED_API_KEY="your-pubmed-api-key"  # Optional, but increases rate limits
SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY="your-semantic-scholar-api-key"
WORKSPACE_ID="your-workspace-id" # Your workspace ID 
```

### Usage

```python
from medinsight.agent import MedInsightPro

# Initialize the MedInsight Pro agent
agent = MedInsightPro()

# Run a query to summarize the latest medical research on COVID-19 treatments
output = agent.run("COVID-19 treatments")
print(output)

```

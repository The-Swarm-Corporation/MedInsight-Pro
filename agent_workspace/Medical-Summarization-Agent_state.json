Long COVID/PASC is the continuation or development of new symptoms after three months from the initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, which lasts for at least two months and has no other identifiable cause. Long COVID/PASC occurs in 10-20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The most common symptoms include fatigue, cognitive impairment (brain fog), and shortness of breath. However, more than 200 symptoms have been reported. No phenotypic or diagnostic biomarkers have been identified for developing long COVID/PASC, which is a multisystem disorder that can present with isolated or combined respiratory, hematological, immunological, cardiovascular, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no cure. Therefore, individualized patient management requires a multidisciplinary clinical approach. Because millions of people have had and continue to have COVID-19, even in the era of vaccination and antiviral therapies, long COVID/PASC is now and will increasingly become a health and economic burden that the world must prepare for. Almost five years from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this article aims to review what is currently known about long COVID/PASC, the anticipated increasing global health burden, and why there is still an urgent need to identify diagnostic biomarkers and risk factors to improve prevention and treatment.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Post-Acute Sequelae of Covid-19: A System-wise Approach on the Effects of Long-Covid-19.\nPMID: 39268246\nAuthors: ['Umakanthan S', 'Katwaroo AR', 'Bukelo M', 'Bg S', 'Boralingaiah P', 'Ranade AV', 'Rangan P', 'Shashidhar S', 'Kini JR', 'Kini G']\nSource: American journal of medicine open\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Dec'}\nAbstract: The SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly impacted global health, economics, and society. This review seeks to encompass an overview of current knowledge on COVID-19, including its transmission, pathogenesis, and clinical presentation related to various systems within the human body. COVID-19 is a highly contagious illness that has rapidly spread worldwide. As of August 4, 2023, the WHO reported over 570 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and over 6.3 million deaths. Although the virus is most common in adults, children can also be infected. Respiratory droplets that are produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes are the primary transmission mode for COVID-19. Additionally, the virus can be disseminated via contact with contaminated surfaces or objects, as it can remain viable for several hours or days. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus that enters cells by bonding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. Once inside the cell, the virus replicates and produces new particles that can infect other cells. Interestingly, the effects of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) encompass more than just respiratory system. The findings presented in the data suggest that PASC significantly impacts multiple organs and their respective physiological processes. In light of these observations, we aim to provide a detailed discussion of the relevant findings in this paper. Through our review, we hope to provide healthcare professionals with a deeper understanding of the effects of PASC on the human body, which could ultimately lead to improved patient outcomes and treatment strategies.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: The Long-Term Cardiovascular Impact of COVID-19: Pathophysiology, Clinical Manifestations, and Management.\nPMID: 39258051\nAuthors: ['Mukkawar RV', 'Reddy H', 'Rathod N', 'Kumar S', 'Acharya S']\nSource: Cureus\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Aug'}\nAbstract: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, has resulted in a substantial global health crisis, with effects extending far beyond the acute phase of infection. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the long-term cardiovascular impact of COVID-19, focusing on the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approaches, management strategies, and future research directions. SARS-CoV-2 induces cardiovascular complications through mechanisms such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and direct myocardial injury, leading to conditions like myocarditis, heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolic events. These long-term effects, collectively called \"long COVID\" or post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), present significant challenges for healthcare systems and patient management. Diagnostic approaches include imaging techniques and laboratory tests to identify and monitor cardiovascular complications. Management strategies emphasize a holistic approach, incorporating pharmacological treatments and lifestyle modifications. Special attention is required for vulnerable populations, including those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions. Ongoing research is essential to understand the full spectrum of long-term cardiovascular impacts and to develop effective treatments. This review highlights the critical need for continued vigilance, multidisciplinary care, and research to address the cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and improve long-term health outcomes for survivors.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Cardiovascular abnormalities of long-COVID syndrome: Pathogenic basis and potential strategy for treatment and rehabilitation.\nPMID: 39234483\nAuthors: ['Wu K', 'Van Name J', 'Xi L']\nSource: Sports medicine and health science\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Sep'}\nAbstract: Cardiac injury and sustained cardiovascular abnormalities in long-COVID syndrome, i.e. post-acute sequelae of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have emerged as a debilitating health burden that has posed challenges for management of pre-existing cardiovascular conditions and other associated chronic comorbidities in the most vulnerable group of patients recovered from acute COVID-19. A clear and evidence-based guideline for treating cardiac issues of long-COVID syndrome is still lacking. In this review, we have summarized the common cardiac symptoms reported in the months after acute COVID-19 illness and further evaluated the possible pathogenic factors underlying the pathophysiology process of long-COVID. The mechanistic understanding of how Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) damages the heart and vasculatures is critical in developing targeted therapy and preventive measures for limiting the viral attacks. Despite the currently available therapeutic interventions, a considerable portion of patients recovered from severe COVID-19 have reported a reduced functional reserve due to deconditioning. Therefore, a rigorous and comprehensive cardiac rehabilitation program with individualized exercise protocols would be instrumental for the patients with long-COVID to regain the physical fitness levels comparable to their pre-illness baseline.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Traditional Chinese Rehabilitation Exercise (TCRE) for Myofascial Pain: Current Evidence and Further Challenges.\nPMID: 39220224\nAuthors: ['Liu X', 'Pan F', 'Wang Q', 'Wang S', 'Zhang J']\nSource: Journal of pain research\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024'}\nAbstract: Myofascial as a holistic structure emphasizes a holistic approach to intervention and treatment of fascial-related disorders such as neck pain (NP), low back pain (LBP), and knee pain. There are currently adverse effects of medication for diseases related to myofascial. Traditional Chinese rehabilitation exercise (TCRE) is a practical approach to traditional Chinese medicine and is a valuable option for intervening in myofascial-related pain. This article found some research evidence for Baduanjin, Wuqinxi, and Yijinjing in clinical studies of myofascial chain-related pain. The article summarizes the current evidence and finds that TCRE can enhance limb movement function through breathing and slow movements, increase joint movement and flexibility, and reduce joint pathology and stress-induced pain. As for future directions, focus on TCRE in improving the health of older adults and treating long-COVID syndrome, and integrate robotic and TCRE training to frame safe and effective exercise models. Relevant studies have already been registered in the Clinical Trials Registry, and some clinical study protocols have been published. TCRE can be an alternative nonpharmacological rehabilitation therapy to alleviate chronic rheumatic pain symptoms and augment public health management.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Impact of Long COVID-19 on Health Outcomes Among Adults With Preexisting Cardiovascular Disease and Hypertension: A Systematic Review.\nPMID: 39211746\nAuthors: ['Daodu TB', 'Rugel EJ', 'Lear SA']\nSource: CJC open\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Aug'}\nAbstract: This review summarizes the impact of long COVID (LC) on the health of adults with preexisting cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. We searched Medline, Web of Science (Core Collection), and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), without language restrictions, for articles published from December 1, 2019 through October 10, 2023, to ensure all relevant studies were captured. We included studies that enrolled adults (aged \u226518 years) diagnosed with CVD prior to COVID-19 infection whose infection was subsequently determined to be LC per the World Health Organization definition. We excluded studies with adults diagnosed with CVD concurrent with or subsequent to COVID-19 or with those who solely self-reported LC. We used a custom-built data extraction form to collect a range of study characteristics. Study quality was assessed using modified versions of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality-assessment tools. A total of 13,779 studies were identified; 53 were included in the final analysis. Of these, 27 were of good quality and 26 were of fair quality. Health outcomes consisted of the presence of prolonged symptoms of LC (n\u00a0= 29), physiological health outcomes (n\u00a0= 20), lifestyle behaviours (n\u00a0= 19), psycho-social outcomes (n\u00a0= 13), CVD complications (n\u00a0= 5), and death and hospital readmission (n\u00a0= 5). Thirty-four studies incorporated 2 or more outcomes, and 19 integrated only\u00a01. Given the significant impact of LC among individuals with preexisting CVD, specially tailored clinical management is needed for members of this population. Additional studies on the impact of LC among those with CVD and other underlying conditions also would be beneficial.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: How are Long-Covid, Post-Sepsis-Syndrome and Post-Intensive-Care-Syndrome related? A conceptional approach based on the current research literature.\nPMID: 39210399\nAuthors: ['Fleischmann-Struzek C', 'Joost FEA', 'Pletz MW', 'Wei\u00df B', 'Paul N', 'Ely EW', 'Reinhart K', 'Rose N']\nSource: Critical care (London, England)\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Aug', 'Day': '29'}\nAbstract: Long-Covid (LC), Post-Sepsis-Syndrome (PSS) and Post-Intensive-Care-Syndrome (PICS) show remarkable overlaps in their clinical presentation. Nevertheless, it is unclear if they are distinct syndromes, which may co-occur in the same patient, or if they are three different labels to describe similar symptoms, assigned on the basis on patient history and professional perspective of the treating physician. Therefore, we reviewed the current literature on the relation between LC, PSS and PICS. To date, the three syndromes cannot reliably be distinguished due similarities in clinical presentation as they share the cognitive, psychological and physical impairments with only different probabilities of occurrence and a heterogeneity in individual expression. The diagnosis is furthermore hindered by a lack of specific diagnostic tools. It can be concluded that survivors after COVID-19 sepsis likely have more frequent and more severe consequences than patients with milder COVID-19 courses, and that are some COVID-19-specific sequelae, e.g. an increased risk for venous thromboembolism in the 30\u00a0days after the acute disease, which occur less often after sepsis of other causes. Patients may profit from leveraging synergies from PICS, PSS and LC treatment as well as from experiences gained from infection-associated chronic conditions in general. Disentangling molecular pathomechanisms may enable future targeted therapies that go beyond symptomatic treatment.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: COVID-19 Coagulopathy.\nPMID: 39202695\nAuthors: ['Rettew A', 'Garrahy I', 'Rahimian S', 'Brown R', 'Sangha N']\nSource: Life (Basel, Switzerland)\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Jul', 'Day': '29'}\nAbstract: Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) is the respiratory viral infection caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being a primary respiratory illness, it is commonly complicated by systemic involvement of the vasculature leading to arterial and venous thrombosis. In this review, we will focus on the association between COVID-19 and thrombosis. We will highlight the pathophysiology of COVID-19 coagulopathy. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 vasculopathy will be discussed with a focus on venous and arterial thromboembolic events. COVID-19 vasculopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) are distinguished within, as well as areas of controversy, such as \"long COVID\". Finally, the current professional guidelines on prevention and treatment of thrombosis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection will be discussed.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Long COVID Syndrome: A Narrative Review on Burden of Age and Vaccination.\nPMID: 39200898\nAuthors: ['Finamore P', 'Arena E', 'Lupoi D', 'Savito L', 'Di Nunzio F', 'Furbatto M', 'Dragonieri S', 'Antonelli Incalzi R', 'Scarlata S']\nSource: Journal of clinical medicine\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Aug', 'Day': '13'}\nAbstract: <b>Background/Objective:</b> The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the emergence of post-acute COVID-19 syndrome, also known as long COVID, which presents a significant challenge due to its varied symptoms and unpredictable course, particularly in older adults. Similar to COVID-19 infections, factors such as age, pre-existing health conditions, and vaccination status may influence the occurrence and severity of long COVID. The objective is to analyze the role of aging in the context of long COVID and to investigate prevalence rates and vaccination efficacy to improve prevention strategies and treatment in this age group. <b>Methods:</b> Four researchers independently conducted a literature search of the PubMed database to trace studies published between July 2020 and July 2024. <b>Results:</b> Aging influences both the likelihood of developing long COVID and the recovery process, due to age-related physiological changes, immune system alterations, and the presence of comorbidities. Vaccination plays a key role in reducing the risk of long COVID by attenuating the inflammatory responses associated with its symptoms. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite the protection vaccines offer against severe infection, hospitalization, and post-infection sequelae, vaccine hesitancy remains a major obstacle, worsening the impact of long COVID. Promising treatments for this condition include antivirals although further research is needed.\n----------------------------------------\n\nTitle: Evaluating the Risk-Benefit Profile of Corticosteroid Therapy for COVID-19 Patients: A Scoping Review.\nPMID: 39195858\nAuthors: ['Tsai DH', 'Harmon E', 'Goelen J', 'Barry HE', 'Chen LY', 'Hsia Y']\nSource: Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)\nPublication Date: {'Year': '2024', 'Month': 'Aug', 'Day': '22'}\nAbstract: The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. It quickly spread across all continents, causing significant social, environmental, health, and economic impacts. During the pandemic, there has been consideration of repurposing and repositioning of medications, such as corticosteroids, for the treatment of hospitalised COVID-19 patients. To assess and summarise corticosteroid regimens used for hospitalised COVID-19 patients, focusing on dosage, route of administration, and clinical outcome from clinical trials. PubMed and Embase databases and the grey literature were searched to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the efficacy of corticosteroids in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 between January 2020 and January 2023. This scoping review was conducted in line with the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. A total of 24 RCTs were eligible for inclusion. There was variation in the steroid regimens used for treatment across COVID-19 trials. Despite the heterogeneity of included RCTs, the overall results have shown the benefits of improving lung function and a lower all-cause mortality rate in hospitalised COVID-19 patients treated with systematic corticosteroids. Corticosteroids have proven to be an effective treatment for COVID-19 patients in critical condition. However, comparative effectiveness studies should be conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of optimal corticosteroid treatment at the population level. Moreover, the global burden of long COVID is significant, affecting millions with persistent symptoms and long-term health complications. Thus, it is also necessary to evaluate the optimal steroid regimen for long COVID treatment.\n----------------------------------------\n\n",
